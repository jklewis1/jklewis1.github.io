Summary

Pixelmate processes photos on your device and saves the result to your device’s Pictures folder. We do not collect, transmit, sell, or share personal data.

Information We Collect

We do not collect any personal information. Pixelmate does not require an account, and the app does not send content or diagnostics to our servers.

How the App Works

You choose a photo using the system photo picker.

Processing happens locally on your device.

The processed image is saved to Pictures/Parabola (or an equivalent system album).

The app does not upload images anywhere.

Permissions

Depending on your Android version, Pixelmate may request:

Photos/Media (read access via the Android photo picker): to let you select an image.

Write to Photos/Storage (older Android versions only): to save the processed image to your device’s Pictures folder.

These permissions are used only for the features described and not for data collection.

Data Sharing & Third Parties

We do not share data with third parties.

We do not use analytics, advertising SDKs, or crash reporting services in the current version.

Data Retention & Your Control

Processed images remain on your device until you delete them.

You can remove Pixelmate at any time and delete saved images in your gallery/files app.

Children’s Privacy

Pixelmate is a general-audience app and does not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe a child has provided us personal information, contact us and we will address it promptly.

International Use

Because the app does not transmit data to our servers, your content remains on your device regardless of your location.

Changes to This Policy

If we add features like analytics or cloud services in the future, we will update this policy and the in-app disclosures. Material changes will be posted on this page with a new “Last updated” date.
